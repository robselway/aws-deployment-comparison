# AWS Deployment Comparison

This repository contains 3 examples of AWS deployment methods:

- CloudFormation
- SAM
- Serverless

The puropse is to demonstrate the difference in terms of lines of configuration and complexity for deploying a simple serverless app made up of a Lambda function and an API Gateway endpoint.

The findings are discussed on my blog: [blog.rob.uk.com](https://blog.rob.uk.com)
